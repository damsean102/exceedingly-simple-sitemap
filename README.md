# Exceeding Simple Sitemap - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
A Wordpress plugin that generates and exclude pages from HTML and XML sitemaps.

The functionality of this plugin is incomplete.

## TODO

1. Work with any custom post type
2. Work out Change frequency from revision dates
3. Streamline the Sitemap creation functions to only run get_posts once. (Build array of Page ID's, pass to each function and loop through them pulling out the appropriate information).
4. Check whether a sitemap.xml file exists, if so only add the pages that need to be added
5. When the plugin is removed, clear the meta from the custom fields (if possible).

Please watch the *Master* branch for when this plugin is ready.
